        Splitting bills can be a pain. How about an app that scans receipts 
        and lets users pick their dishes, then handles tax, tip, and 
        payments?

        <br>
        <br>

        The QuikSplit app will be perfect for eating out with friends. To 
        split a bill, simply:

        <br>
        <br>
        1. Snap a picture of your receipt
        <br>
        2. Match each item to its purchaser
        <br>
        3. Let QuikSplit handle all your Venmo requests
